# UyghurDaily / ئۇيغۇر ئۆپىنكىلاۋ

**UyghurDaily** (ئۇيغۇر ئۆپىنكىلاۋ) is a blog about the situation of Uyghurs:
their struggle, daily life in diaspora, and the fight for freedom.

Here we share:

- reports and reflections on camps, repression, and human rights abuses
- stories and thoughts from Uyghurs in diaspora (Canada and worldwide)
- calls to action and analysis in Uyghur, with optional English summaries

This folder contains the content of the blog. The goal is simple:
keep a consistent, regular record of what is happening to Uyghurs,
written in Uyghur first.
